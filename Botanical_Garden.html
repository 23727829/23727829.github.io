		<p class="post-text">
			For this project, our client Dr. Don Kirkwood (curator of the botanical gardens) 
			had a problem with the functionality of the current botanical garden map, and 
			requested our aid as GIS Expect to make the map more interactive and user friendly.
			On this project we worked as a group of three, each individual had a unique skill 
			set, so we divided the work amongst us. Rutger attained the role of being the 
			administrator as he has strong leadership skills while Joshua and I dealt more with 
			the technical part since were more experienced.
		</p>
		<p class="post-text">
			A six-weeks timeline was agreed upon to complete the project.One of the challenges we experienced 
			in managing the botanical garden project was ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned 
			and working towards the same goals.Also, we used the Gantt chart to organize, sub-divide 
			tasks, and track the progress. This helped us improve our overall efficiency and ensure 
			that we met the deadline.

		<h2 class="sub-heading"><span>GIS Strategy & Implementation</span></h2>
		<p class="post-text">
			The plan was to utilize ArcGIS Pro and the online version for mapping and visual paradigm 
			to compute our conceptual and logical design for our geodatabase.This enabled us to was 
			highlight the important entities involved in the project and implement our strategy.With 
			the conceptual planning,we focused on developing a clear understanding of the project
			requirements,and created a high-level view of the project.

		<h2 class="sub-heading"><span>Data Preparation</span></h2>
		<p class="post-text">
			A plant collection recorded as an Excel sheet and Building shapefile was provided.However 
			there were missing entities and overlapping polygons thus we had to redigitize a few polygons 
			and also clean the data collection. This was all made possible through excel and ArcGIS Pro Software.

		<p class="post-text">
			Once the raw data was processed, analysed and the editing process was completed, the construction 
			phase commenced. The build process of the prototype of an interactive map included the making additional map
			layers, followed by the actual creation of the map and to adding functionality to it.the interactive
			features of the map included zooming in and out, panning across the map to explore the map in detail, 
			clicking on individual points to view more information, and toggling between different layers and base 
			maps.
		</p>
		<p class="post-text">
			Overall, the project was a great learning experience. Managing a project and meeting goals on time 
			requires precise planning and management. Implementing the right steps at the right time is crucial 
			to the project's overall outcome.
